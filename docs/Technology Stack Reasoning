The tehcnology stack that our group chose was React frontend, Flask backend and mongoDB database. We will compare them to Node.js, Django and SQL.

Frontend:
Although React and Node.js both are popular open-source JavaScript frameworks, they differ in how they involve in tasks:
For example, React is used to build websites and user interfaces, which is more specific. Also, compared to Node.js, the 
learning curve of React is easier.

Backend:
We used python as our backend language and flask as the backend framework of the project. It helps to chain web server and 
web application together to process requests. Compared to Django which covers comprehensive features, Flask is micro and 
more suitable for building a light web application like Music Forecast. There are many features of Django that are not needed,
so Flask is a better choice.

Database:
Compared to SQL, we are going to use NoSQL database. By calling OpenWeather's and Spotify's APIs, we need to get access to 
data such as city name, temperature, playlist, album profile, etc. 
Below are 2 reasons to choose NoSQL over SQL: 
1. We might constantly add new features. 
2. Data we need vary in data types.
The whole process will be much easier and flexible if we use NoSQL rather than SQL.
