The tehcnology stack that our group chose was React frontend, python backend and mongoDB database. We will compare it to the Node technology stack.
Frontend:
Although React and Node.js both are popular open-source JavaScript frameworks, they differ in how they involve in tasks:
For example, React is used to build websites and user interfaces, which is more specific. Also, compared to Node.js, the 
learning curve of React is easier.
Backend:
We are going to use Python instead of Java for the backend. Both Java and Python have extensive libraries, but Python is more
human-readable and its syntax allows us to write the same thing as using Java but with less code.
Database:
Compared to SQL, we are going to use NoSQL database. By calling OpenWeather's and Spotify's APIs, we need to get access to data such as
city name, temperature, playlist, album profile, etc. 
Below are 2 reasons to choose NoSQL over SQL: 
1. We might constantly add new features. 
2. Data we need vary in data types.
The whole process will be much easier and flexible if we use NoSQL rather than SQL.
