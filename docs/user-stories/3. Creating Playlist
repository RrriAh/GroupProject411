As a logged-in user, I want to choose whether I want songs to match the current weather or songs opposite so that I can listen to music that matches the weather 
and my mood. 

When a user enters the music player, it should ask if they wish to match the mood or look for something different. If an option is chosen, a music 
playlist is made for the user that matches their inputs. Users can cancel out of it and nothing would happen, or they can choose to switch to the current
weather in order to play songs again that correlate to the current weather.
