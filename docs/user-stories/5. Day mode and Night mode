As a logged-in user, I want to change from day-time mode to night mode so that I can listen to music at night without bright light, 
or if I prefer to stay in night mode I can keep it on night mode throughout the day. Automatically, the application will default to day-time mode. 
The user will be able to go to settings to switch from day-time mode to night mode with the simple switch of a button in settings. 
The user's settings will be preserved for the next login.
