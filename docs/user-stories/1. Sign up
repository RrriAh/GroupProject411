As a new user, I want to register for an account with Music Forecast so that I can listen to music based on the weather. 

For any user to sign up for Music Forecast, a valid email address is required. If the email address has been used, the 
page will tell the user to re-enter another valid email address. A verification link will be sent to the user's email 
address if the address is valid. The user needs to click the link to finish the new-user registration process. After the
email address is verified, the user can set up the login password. At the end of the process, the user will complete 
information such as setting up a profile picture, username, and bio.

Users can later use the email address and login password to log in.
