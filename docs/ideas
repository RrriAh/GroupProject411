1. Financial performance application

This application will make use of the Yahoo Finance API to gather financial data on corporations and return trends in financial statements. 
After signing in using OAuth, a user will lookup the company of their choice and then be returned a graph of the company's trends in profitability. 
The application will also deliver the user a few options to select from in case they would prefer to find the trends of another component inside
the financial statement. Using this application, a user will be able to better gauge if a company is a good financial investment for the future based
on the company's performance.

4. Recommend songs based on daily temperature and weather

First, this application would ask users to store their profiles.
For this application, the use of Spotify API would help to gather users' related data and their playlists, combined with OpenWeather API which 
provides current weather data. Using OAuth, users could sign in via Spotify. The application has two options for sending songs in response to the current
temperature and weather. One will look for songs of the opposite vibe: if the day's cold, it might give users some cozy-feeling songs. The other one will
look for correlated songs: if it's rainy, there will be songs about rain, melancholy, etc. The application fulfills different users' purposes. Users can 
simply just listen to the music that matches the ambiance and enjoy it. Yet, if they feel terrible because of freezing days or thunderstorms, users can 
also cheer themselves up with songs recommended by the application.
